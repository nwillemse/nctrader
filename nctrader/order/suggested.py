    A SuggestedOrder object is generated by the PortfolioHandler
    to be sent to the PositionSizer object and subsequently the
    RiskManager object. Creating a separate object type for
    suggested orders and final orders (OrderEvent objects) ensures
    that a suggested order is never transacted unless it has been

        Initialises the SuggestedOrder. The quantity defaults
